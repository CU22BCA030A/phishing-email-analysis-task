## 🚨 Identified Phishing Indicators

| 🔍 Indicator | 🚩 Description |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Spoofed Sender Address** | The email is from `support@msupdate.net`, which is not an official Microsoft domain. Legitimate emails come from `@microsoft.com` or `@account.microsoft.com`. |
| **Not Personalized** | No mention of the user's name; uses a generic or missing greeting. Trusted services usually personalize security notifications. |
| **Urgency and Fear Tactics** | The phrase “your account has been compromised” is designed to create panic and force the recipient into immediate action. |
| **Suspicious Links** | Multiple links encourage users to “Reset your password” or “Review your security info.” These links could lead to phishing websites mimicking Microsoft login pages. |
| **Brand Impersonation** | Uses Microsoft's branding and typical language structure to appear authentic. However, there are subtle inconsistencies that indicate it’s not legitimate. |
